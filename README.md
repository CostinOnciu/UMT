## I assumed that the booked hours are given in increasing order.
Also, I think ['11:30', '12:30'] is not valid, it should have been
['11:30','12:00'] because the first person has booked a meeting from
12:00 to 13:00. 


**also I read from a file, and the input will be just the lists**

**For example:**

[['9:00','10:30'], ['12:00','13:00'], ['16:00','18:00]] 

['9:00','20:00']

[['10:00','11:30'], ['12:30','14:30'], ['14:30','15:00], ['16:00','17:00']]

['10:00','18:30']
